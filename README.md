## Overview

Welcome to the **Linux Syslog Insights** project! This repository contains a Splunk project designed to analyze simulated Linux syslog data. Our main goal is to detect brute-force login attempts, identify error rate anomalies, escalate warnings, and correlate security events. 

Through this project, you will gain insights into advanced Search Processing Language (SPL), time-window correlation, and lookup-based classification. We present real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) insights through engaging storytelling dashboards.

## Features

- **Brute-Force Detection**: Identify potential brute-force login attempts with accuracy.
- **Error Rate Anomalies**: Monitor and detect unusual error rates in syslog data.
- **Escalated Warnings**: Set up alerts for critical issues that require immediate attention.
- **Correlated Security Events**: Link related security events for comprehensive analysis.
- **Advanced SPL**: Utilize advanced Search Processing Language techniques for data analysis.
- **Time-Window Correlation**: Analyze events over specified time windows for better insights.
- **Lookup-Based Classification**: Use lookups to classify events effectively.
- **Storytelling Dashboards**: Create engaging dashboards that tell the story of your data.

## Installation

To get started with **Linux Syslog Insights**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaudharijeel9673/linux-syslog-insights.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/chaudharijeel9673/linux-syslog-insights/releases). Follow the instructions to execute the necessary files.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can begin using it to analyze syslog data.

1. **Import Data**: Load your simulated Linux syslog data into Splunk.
2. **Run Queries**: Use the provided SPL queries to detect brute-force attempts and anomalies.
3. **Explore Dashboards**: Access the dashboards to visualize your data insights.

## Data Sources

The project uses synthetic data to simulate Linux syslog entries. This data includes various login attempts, error messages, and warning logs. The synthetic data is structured to mimic real-world scenarios, making it ideal for testing and analysis.

## Dashboards

The dashboards in this project are designed to provide a clear view of the data. They feature:

- **Brute-Force Login Attempts**: A dashboard displaying login attempts over time, highlighting suspicious activities.
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Visualizations that show error rates and any anomalies detected.
- **Security Event Correlation**: A comprehensive view of correlated security events for easier investigation.
